# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
This is a code refactor challenge for Columbia Engineer Coding Boot Camp Sept 2021. In this task, I was given a starter code to make it accessible and to improve SEO.

In the process of refactoring, I have: 

1. Added semantic HTML elements: header,footer,nav,section.
2. Restructured the HTML elements so that they follow the following order: head,nav,body,header,sections,and footer.
3. Added alt attribute to images and explicit "" alt to icons.
4. Made sure headings are in sequential order.
5. Modified project title and meta name and content to reflect the website's name and description.
6. Consolidate the classes and ids with in the contents and benefits and updated CSS to reflect this. The consolidation reduced 2/3 of the CSS styling in these two sections.
7. Reduced the size of images and icons by 89% to improve loading time.
